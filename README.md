– Developed a custom dynamic heap allocator with metadata tracking for contiguous memory blocks using doubly
linked lists.
– Implemented efficient block splitting, merging, and allocation algorithms to optimize memory utilization and reduce
fragmentation.
– Ensured safe memory deallocation with boundary checks and robust pointer arithmetic for high-performance
embedded-like environments
